This is final project for course I'm attending in Comtrade, Belgrade, Serbia.<br /><br />
The task was to create Web application using ASP.NET project with T-SQL code first, at least one Stored Procedure and at least one View. From web pages side it must have all four Create-Read-Update-Delete functionality.

### This project
This project started form empty template ASP.NET Web pages.<br />
It uses Bootstrap 4, imported to project by NuGet packages, links:
- https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/jumbotron/
- https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/alerts/

Database is added to project manually and tables are created by executing query (T-SQL code included in project file).
